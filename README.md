# Anime-Face-generation

## Description of the dataset

In this project, I generate Anime faces through GAN and WGAN with the [dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/anime-faces) from Kaggle. In the dataset, there are total 21551 Anime Face images used as trainind data. Some examples of images are attached as following:

Due to the limit of computation power, I encode each image as a $64\times 64\times 3$ tensor.

## Introduction of GAN model

The GAN model contains two parts: the generator and the discriminator. Different GAN models will have different architectures for the generator or the discriminator. Generator receives a random vector as input and outputs an fake image. In this project, I only talk about the unconditional GAN model. The conditional GAN model could have other specific input besides a random vector. The discriminator use some images sampled from the training image data and fake images generated by the generator as input, and output a scalar value that represents the similarity between the fake images and the true images. Roles of the generator and the discriminator are summarized as follows.

- Generator: Be trained to produce fake images to deceive the discriminator.
- Discriminator: Be trained to distinguish fake images from the generator and the true images from the training data.

As a base model, I trained a binary classifer as the discriminator which labels true images as 1 and fake images as 0. Thus, the 'binarycrossentropy' loss is used for the discriminator. Other losses could also be used, such as wasserstein distance, which is called 'WGAN'.
The generator and the discriminator are trained alternately.
The structure of the generator and the discriminator are attached.
